	"content": "If you have a card that matches the one on the discard pile you can throw that card onto the pile and call it out, you may only call out on a card once so you have to be very fast with your calling out, alternatively you can also call out someone else's card so that they get a 2 card penalty. If you call out the wrong card you get a penalty of 1 card and if you look at your card without a 7 or 10 you also get a 1 card penalty (you may not look at your penalties when you get them)"
