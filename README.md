# Reds

Reds is a card game you can play with friends in real life. It is a game of memory, strategy and wits!  
Our [website](https://reds-game.pages.dev) can help you learn how to play!
I learnt it from [@ferboinkles](https://github.com/ferboinkles) and, using my technical skills, wanted to share it with you.  
Together, we want to teach you Reds.

### If you want to run it locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Do `npm install` or `bun install` (recommended) to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` or `bun dev` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
5. Enjoy!
6. To build for production, run `npm run build` or `bun build` and then `npm start` or `bun start`
7. Your production server will be running on `http://localhost:4173`
8. If you wanna edit the code, read the svelte docs [here](https://svelte.dev/docs)
